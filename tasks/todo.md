# Tasks / Todo - Event-Driven Football Prediction System

---

## ARCHITECTURE: Event-Driven Architecture

### Why Event-Driven?
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket support for live predictions/odds
- **Multi-user**: Natural fan-out to multiple clients
- **Scalability**: Decoupled handlers can scale independently
- **Audit trail**: Events provide built-in history

### Core Principles
1. Events are immutable facts
2. Handlers react to events, never block emission
3. Caching layered on top for performance
4. Market-specific models trained independently

---

## PHASE 1: Event Foundation (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Event Base System
- [ ] Create `src/events/base.py` - BaseEvent class with timestamp, type, payload
- [ ] Create `src/events/registry.py` - Event type registry
- [ ] Tests: `tests/events/test_base.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Emit event, verify handlers called

### 1.2 Fixture Events
- [ ] Create `src/events/fixture_events.py`
  - `FixtureScheduled` - New fixture added
  - `FixtureUpdated` - Fixture details changed
  - `FixtureCompleted` - Match finished (FT)
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/fixture_handler.py`
- [ ] Tests: `tests/events/test_fixture.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Fetch fixture → emit event → verify DB updated

### 1.3 Odds Events
- [ ] Create `src/events/odds_events.py`
  - `OddsUpdated` - Odds changed for fixture
  - `OddsStale` - Odds older than threshold
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/odds_handler.py`
- [ ] Tests: `tests/events/test_odds.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Update odds → emit event → verify predictions recalculated

### 1.4 Settlement Events
- [ ] Create `src/events/settlement_events.py`
  - `PredictionCreated` - New prediction generated
  - `PredictionSettled` - Prediction resolved
  - `BetSettled` - Bet resolved with P&L
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/settlement_handler.py`
- [ ] Tests: `tests/events/test_settlement.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Complete fixture → settle predictions → verify P&L

### 1.5 Model Events
- [ ] Create `src/events/model_events.py`
  - `ModelTrained` - New model version trained
  - `ModelDegraded` - Drift detected
  - `ModelActivated` - Model made live
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/model_handler.py`
- [ ] Tests: `tests/events/test_model.py`

### 1.6 Git Checkpoint
- [ ] Commit all Phase 1 work
- [ ] Tag: `v0.1-event-base`

---

## PHASE 2: Handler Infrastructure (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Settle Handler (From daily_run)
- [ ] Refactor `scripts/settle_fixtures.py` to emit events
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/settle_handler.py`
  - Consumes `FixtureCompleted`
  - Updates predictions
  - Calculates P&L
- [ ] Tests: `tests/handlers/test_settle.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Run settle → verify all events processed

### 2.2 Odds Handler
- [ ] Refactor odds fetching to emit events
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/odds_handler.py`
  - Consumes `OddsUpdated`
  - Triggers prediction recalculation if EV changed
- [ ] Tests: `tests/handlers/test_odds.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Poll odds → verify predictions update

### 2.3 Backfill Handler
- [ ] Create `src/handlers/backfill_handler.py`
  - Handles historic data recovery
  - Short-term backfill (2h-24h history)
- [ ] Tests: `tests/handlers/test_backfill.py`

### 2.4 Git Checkpoint
- [ ] Commit all Phase 2 work
- [ ] Tag: `v0.2-handlers`

## PHASE 3: Prediction Caching (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Cache Infrastructure
- [ ] Create `src/cache/prediction_cache.py`
  - TTL-based cache per market
  - Cache invalidation on events
  - Market-specific TTLs (BTTS: 2h, H2H: 1h)
- [ ] Tests: `tests/cache/test_prediction.py`

### 3.2 Cache Integration
- [ ] Integrate cache into web_ui predictions API
- [ ] Event-driven cache invalidation
- [ ] Tests: `tests/cache/test_integration.py`
- [ ] Manual test: Load predictions → verify cache works

### 3.3 Git Checkpoint
- [ ] Commit all Phase 3 work
- [ ] Tag: `v0.3-cache`

---

## PHASE 4: Multi-Market Expansion (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 API-Football Market Discovery
- [ ] Research all bet_type IDs from API
- [ ] Document markets in `docs/markets/`
- [ ] Create placeholder event types for future markets

### 4.2 Markets to Implement
Based on API-Football coverage:

**Current Markets (Working):**
- H2H (bet_type=1) - Match Winner ✅
- BTTS (bet_type=5) - Both Teams To Score ✅
- O/U 2.5 (bet_type=4) - Over/Under 2.5 ✅

**Markets to Add:**
- O/U 1.5 (bet_type=?) - Over/Under 1.5 ⚠️
- Asian Handicap (bet_type=3) - Line-based handicap ⚠️
- Correct Score (bet_type=6) - Exact score ⚠️
- HT/FT (bet_type=7) - Half Time/Full Time ⚠️
- Double Chance (bet_type=?) - 2 of 3 outcomes ⚠️
- Draw No Bet (bet_type=?) - No draw option ⚠️
- Goalscorer (bet_type=?) - First/anytime scorer ⚠️

### 4.3 Feature Requirements per Market
```
Market         | Features Needed
--------------|----------------------------------
H2H           | Elo, form, home/away splits, h2h
BTTS          | Goals scored, goals conceded, form
O/U 1.5       | Scoring frequency, low-scoring teams
O/U 2.5       | Average goals, form
Asian Handicap| Elo difference, home advantage
Correct Score | Poisson, goal distribution
HT/FT         | First half form, second half form
Goalscorer    | Player goals, assists, injuries
```

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests (Run on every change)
```bash
pytest tests/events/ -v
pytest tests/handlers/ -v
pytest tests/cache/ -v
```

### Integration Tests (Run before commit)
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --integration
```

### Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] Emit FixtureCompleted → verify predictions settled
- [ ] Update odds → verify EV recalculated
- [ ] Check prediction page loads from cache
- [ ] Verify new market appears in dropdown
- [ ] Check drift detection triggers alert

### Performance Tests
- [ ] 100 fixtures: < 500ms load time
- [ ] Cache hit rate: > 90%
- [ ] Event processing: < 100ms latency

---

## GIT STRATEGY

### Commit Frequency
- After each phase completion
- After significant feature
- After bug fix with test

### Tagging
- `v0.1-event-base` - Phase 1 complete
- `v0.2-handlers` - Phase 2 complete
- `v0.3-cache` - Phase 3 complete
- `v0.4-markets` - Phase 4 complete
- `v0.5-training` - Phase 5 complete
- `v1.0-realtime` - Phase 6 complete

### Rollback Plan
- Each tag is a deployable state
- `git checkout v0.1-event-base` to revert

## CURRENT PRIORITY

**NEXT**: Phase 1.1 - Event Base System

**IMMEDIATE TASKS**:
1. Create `src/events/base.py`
2. Create `src/events/registry.py`
3. Write basic tests
4. Manual verification
5. Git commit with tag

## LESSONS LEARNED (Updated)

- [x] Events must be immutable
- [x] Handlers should not block event emission
- [x] Cache invalidation should be event-driven
- [x] Each market needs its own model/features
- [x] Commit before major refactors
- [x] Test incrementally, not at end
